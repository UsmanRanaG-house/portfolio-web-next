                <p>Hi, I am <strong>Usman Rana,</strong><br></br>
I am a dedicated freelancer and a passionate graphic design instructor at Lingversity. With over two and a half years of professional freelancing experience on Fiverr, I have successfully collaborated with a diverse range of clients on various projects. My focus has always been on delivering high-quality work with on-time performance, ensuring client satisfaction at every stage.
In addition to my freelancing career, I have been teaching graphic design at Lingversity for the past year. During this time, I designed a comprehensive, project-based syllabus that emphasizes personalized learning experiences for students. This approach not only fosters creativity and engagement but also ensures that students find the projects relevant and exciting, avoiding monotony in the learning process.
Academically, I completed my matriculation from Mumtaz Vision Academy and am currently pursuing my intermediate studies at DJ Sindh Government Science College. Looking ahead, I aspire to earn a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from NED University in Karachi, a goal that reflects my commitment to personal and professional growth.
I have also been enrolled at GIAIC for over a year, where I acquired a solid foundation in web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and custom CSS. These skills have further enhanced my ability to undertake and excel in technical projects.
With a strong dedication to learning and growth, I eagerly look forward to embracing new opportunities, contributing to impactful projects, and achieving significant milestones in the years to come.</p>
